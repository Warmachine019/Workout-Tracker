# Workout-Tracker
Workout tracker in python which uses natural launguage queries.
Uses the nutritionix API to convert a natural language query into a json file which is used to insert data into a google spreadsheet using the Sheety API.
You can enter whatever workout you performed and it is inserted into the spreadsheet with the duration and the estimated amount of calories burnt.
Replace all the variables in "main.py" with your information.
